Ubuntu on OCI container registries
==================================

**Ubuntu is one of the world's most popular container images,** a minimalistic Ubuntu image that offers the same security, versatility, and update cadence as other Ubuntu offerings. It is a developer favourite in container registries such as Docker Hub, with up to 30,000 pulls per week.

**Available in all major OCI container registries,** such as Microsoft's ACR, Amazon's ECR, and of course, Docker Hub, as an official image from a verified publisher - Canonical. 

**A base container for trusted application images.** Container image provenance is a key aspect of any supply chain. The Ubuntu container image offers the ideal starting point for your application images, both in utility and trustworthiness.

**Compatible with multiple platforms and available in different flavours.** The Ubuntu container image is published as a multi-arch Open Container Initiative (OCI) image, available for ``amd64``, ``arm``, ``arm64``, ``ppc64le`` and ``s390x``. Ubuntu Pro is also available for containers, which means hardened and security-enhanced versions of the public Ubuntu container image are also available.
