Ubuntu on IBM
=============


**Ubuntu on IBM is a set of customised Ubuntu images** that allow easy access to a wide range 
of products and services - offered by both IBM cloud and Canonical. These images have an optimised
kernel that boots faster, has a smaller footprint and includes IBM-specific drivers.

**These images provide a foundation for deploying cloud-based software solutions,** specifically
for software built on Ubuntu and running on IBM cloud. They focus on providing the optimal tools 
and features needed to run specific workloads.
