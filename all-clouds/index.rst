Ubuntu on public cloud
======================


**Ubuntu is the world's most popular cloud operating system across public clouds.** Thanks to its security, versatility and policy of regular updates, Ubuntu is the leading cloud guest OS and the only free cloud operating system with the option of enterprise-grade commercial support.

**Optimised and certified Ubuntu images are available for various cloud partners,** such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud and Oracle. By design, these images include an optimised Linux kernel for each cloud, resulting in superior performance and functionality across all instance types and services.

**These images allow easy access to a wide range of cloud-related products and services.** They create a stable and secure cloud platform. A platform that can be used for developing and deploying large-scale production-level software solutions.

**Everyone from individual developers to large enterprises use these Ubuntu images** on the public cloud of their choice. Highly regulated industries from the government, medical and finance sectors, use specific security-certified versions of these images for their workloads.

Public cloud partners

Canonical in collaboration with cloud partners such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, creates optimised Ubuntu images for each of those clouds. These images are available in the respective marketplaces, and work seamlessly across different platforms within each cloud. 

Canonical continuously tracks and delivers updates to these images, ensuring built-in security and stability. As a result, Ubuntu is the platform of choice on most clouds, both for virtual machines and for container workloads.
