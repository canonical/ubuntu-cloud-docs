Ubuntu public images
====================

**Canonical produce generic (generic kernel) cloud images, LXD images (rootfs tarballs) and KVM optimised cloud images (KVM kernel)**. These images are public (unlike other cloud-specific images) and are available on `cloud-images.ubuntu.com <http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com>`_.
