Start: How to contribute

These docs are located on the GitHub repository named `ubuntu-cloud-docs`_, and you'll need a GitHub account to make contributions. It is a good idea to fork this repository into your account before you start, otherwise, GitHub will prompt you to do so when you attempt your first change. 

This documentation set is:

* structured using the `Diátaxis`_ approach
* written in `reStructuredText`_ as per the `Canonical style guide`_
* built with `Sphinx`_
* hosted on `Read the Docs`_

We are always looking for ways to improve our docs, so we appreciate your contributions! 

Suggestions and questions
-------------------------

Use the :guilabel:`Give feedback` button to create a GitHub issue for any suggestions or questions that you might have.

Minor changes
-------------

On any page, if you find a problem that can be fixed with a small change, you can use the **pencil icon** next to the 'Give feedback' button to edit it directly on GitHub. When you are done with your edits, select :guilabel:`Commit changes...` to create a new branch and start a pull request (PR). Use :guilabel:`Propose changes` to submit the PR. We will review it and merge the changes.


New content
-----------

When adding new content, it's easier to work with the documentation on your local machine. Once the content is created, ensure that all checks pass and things looks satisfactory, before submitting a pull request (PR). 

As a prerequisite, you'll need ``make`` and ``python3`` installed on your system. 

Download and install the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are working with these docs for the first time, you'll need to create a fork of the `ubuntu-cloud-docs`_ repository on your GitHub account and then clone that fork to your local machine. Once cloned, go into the ubuntu-cloud-docs directory and run:

.. code::

	make install

This creates a virtual environment and installs all the required dependencies. You only have to do this step once and can skip it the next time you want to contribute.

Build and serve the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``make run`` command to build and serve the docs at ``http://127.0.0.1:8000`` or equivalently at ``http://localhost:8000``. This gives you a live preview of the changes that you make (and save), without the need for a rebuild:

Create content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose the appropriate folder for your content. The folders within each project are mapped to the `Diátaxis`_ categories of tutorial, how-to guides, explanation and reference. If required, the categories can have subcategories as well, as shown in the tree structure below. Also, each folder includes an ``index.rst`` file, which acts as a landing page for the folder.

.. code-block:: none

   project/
   ├── tutorial
   ├── how-to-guides/
   │   ├── subcategory-one/
   │   │   ├── index.rst
   │   │   ├── page-one.rst
   │   │   ├── page-two.rst
   │   │   └── page-three.rst
   │   └── subcategory-two/
   │   |   ├── index.rst
   │   |   ├── page-one.rst
   │   |   ├── page-two.rst
   │   |   └── page-three.rst
   |   └── index.rst 
   ├── explanation
   ├── reference
   └── index.rst

If your required category or subcategory is absent, create them using the instructions given below. Then add your content by creating a new page.

Create new categories (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create new categories by following these steps:

1. Create a new folder in your documentation directory.
2. Create a new ``index.rst`` file within your new folder.
3. Add the title of your new category to the first line of the ``index.rst`` file. Underline it using equal signs (=) that match the length of your title. For more information on titles and headings, read the `reStructuredText`_ style guide.
4. In the ``index.rst`` file, add content introducing the category, its purpose, and other relevant links.
5. In your ``index.rst`` file, add a toctree that specifies the file names of pages and the index files of the subcategories within your newly created category. The toctree should resemble the following structure:

.. code:: rst

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 2

      subcategory-one/index
      Subcategory two <subcategory-two/index>
      page-one-file-name

For more information, read the `Sphinx documentation on toctree`_.

6. Update the project's main ``index.rst`` file by adding your new category to its toctree.

Create new subcategories (optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create new subcategories by following these steps:

1. Go to the parent category and create a new folder for your subcategory within it.
2. Create an ``index.rst`` file within the subcategory folder.
3. Enter the title of your new subcategory on the first line of the ``index.rst`` file. Underline it using equal signs (=) that match the length of your title. For more information on titles and headings, read the `reStructuredText`_ style guide.
4. In the ``index.rst`` file, add content introducing the subcategory, its purpose, and other relevant links.
5. In your ``index.rst`` file, add a toctree that includes the file names or titles of pages within your new subcategory. The toctree should resemble the following structure:

.. code:: rst

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      page-one-file-name
      Page Two Title <page-two-file-name>

6. Update the ``index.rst`` file of the parent category by adding a reference to the newly created subcategory in its toctree.

Create new pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create new pages by following these steps:

1. Create a new file within a category or subcategory.
#. Add a title to the first line of the file. Underline it using equal signs (=) that match the length of your title. For more information on titles and headings, read the `reStructuredText`_ style guide.
#. Add content to the new file using `reStructuredText`_ and following the `Canonical style guide`_.
#. Update the category or subcategory's ``index.rst`` file by adding the file name or your preferred title to the toctree. For more information, read the `Sphinx documentation on toctree`_.

Start: Maintain content

Maintaining Content
-------------------

PR review
~~~~~~~~~
Once a PR is created, it will be reviewed by:

* relevant team members for technical accuracy and 
* the team's Technical Author (TA) for verifying adherence to documentation standards


Periodic content review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A periodic review of the docs is necessary to ensure its accuracy. For this:

* The TA adds every new page to a maintenance list with details such as:

  - `Date checked`: The latest date on which the page was last reviewed
  - `Link to the page`: A URL to the page
  - `Owner`: The person who is able to verify the page's accuracy
  - `Specific content to be verified` (Optional)

* The TA has regular 1:1 meetings with every `Owner`. Any page that hasn't been checked for accuracy in the past 6 months is verified. If the verification cannot be completed during the meeting, a follow-up ticket is created for the same.
