Start: Product need and user

**The images create a stable and secure cloud platform** that is ideal for scaling development work
done on Ubuntu-based systems. Since Ubuntu is one of the most favored operating systems among
developers, using an Ubuntu-based image for the corresponding cloud deployment becomes the simplest
option.

**Everyone from individual developers to large enterprises use these images** for developing and deploying
their softwares. For highly regulated industries from the government, medical and finance sectors, 
various security-certified images are also available.

Start: Daily vs release images

Our image retention policy depends on the type of Ubuntu image, we publish two types:

* *release* images - fully tested, production grade images that benefit from Canonical's in-life support
* *daily* images - untested builds that contain all the latest updates from the Ubuntu archive

End: Daily vs release images
