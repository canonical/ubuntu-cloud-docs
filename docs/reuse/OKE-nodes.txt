.. Introduction to Ubuntu OKE node

==============================================================

Start: Intro and prereqs

Ubuntu images are available for worker nodes on Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) in Oracle Cloud. Currently there are only a select number of suites and Kubernetes versions supported due to this being a Limited Availability release. For a list of supported OKE configurations, see our :doc:`Ubuntu availability on OKE </oracle-reference/ubuntu-availability-on-oke>` page.

For node stability, the ``unattended-upgrades`` package has been removed from the Ubuntu image for OKE. Should your nodes need updates or security patches then refer to the Oracle documentation on `node cycling for managed nodes`_ and `node cycling for self-managed nodes`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

You'll need:

- Oracle Cloud compartment to create the nodes.

- Oracle's ``oci`` CLI installed.

- ``kubectl`` installed.

- `Domain`_, `Dynamic Group and Policy`_ configured (Self-Managed only).

Start: Find and register an image

Find an Ubuntu image
-----------------------

Select a version from the :doc:`available releases </oracle-reference/ubuntu-availability-on-oke>`. The images are listed in a JSON file accessible through a link in the column titled *LOCATION*. They are listed in ascending order, therefore the latest image will be at the bottom. Make a note of the image path for the image you choose, it conforms to the following format:

.. code:: bash
  
  <suite>/oke-<version>/<serial>/<image-name>.img

If you wish to get the latest image path, use the following command:

.. code:: bash
  
  curl <available-releases-location-link> | jq ".[][-2] | .name"

where ``<available-releases-location-link>`` is the link specified in the *LOCATION* column for your chosen release.


Register the Ubuntu image
-------------------------

Images must be registered to be used with Oracle Cloud services. To learn more, refer to the Oracle Cloud documentation for `managing custom images`_.

When registering images, the :guilabel:`Launch mode` is an option to configure. The suggested configurations are :guilabel:`PARAVIRTUALIZED` for virtual nodes and :guilabel:`NATIVE` for bare-metal nodes.

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: Using cloud console
    
        Start the registration process in Oracle Cloud by navigating to :guilabel:`Compute` > :guilabel:`Custom Images` and select :guilabel:`Import Image`. Select :guilabel:`Import from an Object Storage URL`, then paste the :doc:`available releases </oracle-reference/ubuntu-availability-on-oke>` location link with your concatenated image path into the :guilabel:`Object Storage URL` field. The URL format pasted should conform to the following:

        .. code:: bash
         
          <available-releases-location-link>/<image-path>
    
        In the rest of the form, you must provide your :guilabel:`Compartment`, :guilabel:`Image name`, and :guilabel:`Launch mode`. Additionally the fields :guilabel:`Operating System` and :guilabel:`Image type` must be provided and use ``Ubuntu`` and ``QCOW2``, respectively.

        Lastly, select :guilabel:`Import image` and wait for the registration to complete. This process is expected to take a while.

    .. group-tab:: Using CLI
    
        The following command will directly import your image from a provided URI. You'll have to provide the values below with the exception of ``operating-system`` and ``source-image-type`` which are already provided.
        
        For more information on this command, refer to the ``oci`` docs for `import from-object-uri`_.

        .. code:: bash
    
            oci compute image import from-object-uri \
                --compartment-id <compartment-id> \
                --uri <available-release-location-link>/<image-path> \
                --display-name <image-name> \
                --launch-mode <launch-mode> \
                --image-source-object-name <object-name> \
                --operating-system "Ubuntu" \
                --operating-system-version <ubuntu-version-number> \
                --source-image-type QCOW2
