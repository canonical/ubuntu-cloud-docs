Ubuntu Pro on AWS
=================

`Ubuntu Pro`_ is a paid offering that 
provides expanded security coverage, enhanced kernel patching, and 
hardening options for compliance frameworks.

Pro product availability on AWS
-------------------------------
Ubuntu Pro images are available for the following products.

* Base server products
* EKS worker images 
* `Amazon WorkSpaces`_

For launching server and EKS pro products, refer to 
:doc:`../aws-how-to/instances/launch-ubuntu-ec2-instance`

Pro feature overview
--------------------

Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`ESM`_ extends the security patching of
the main archive to 10 years through the ``esm-infra`` entitlement. In addition
to patching the core of Ubuntu (i.e. the `Ubuntu main` repository), Pro also offers security maintenance of the 
`Ubuntu universe` repository. This security coverage is considered best effort
without Ubuntu Pro.

Livepatch
~~~~~~~~~
`Livepatch`_ applies security updates
to the kernel for critical and high security vulnerabilities in a live system.
This allows system administrators to minimize downtime between
scheduled maintenance windows. This is particularly helpful for workloads
that are expensive to migrate, such as kubernetes workers for EKS.

Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~
Ubuntu Pro offers compliance options for users that need to apply 
CIS (level 1 and 2) or FIPS hardening. FIPS is currently supported
on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. For 22.04, it is currently available through the
`fips-preview` and `fips-updates` repositories provided through the 
FIPS pro entitlement, but these modules are not yet approved by NIST.
