Launch QCOW images using QEMU
=============================

Ubuntu cloud images are released in many formats to enable many launch configurations and methods.

Among the many formats for cloud images is the ``.img`` QCOW format. This article will cover the QCOW use case and provide
instructions on how to use the images with QEMU.

Note that the commands in this guide are for x86_64 (amd64) systems. QEMU does offer cross-architecture emulation, so
if you are using a computer with a different CPU architecture, some adjustments to the commands will be required. Check
the `QEMU`_ docs for the correct commands to use for your desired architecture.

For starting with an ISO server image, see the `server documentation`_ on downloading and converting an ISO for use
with QEMU.

QEMU and QCOW
--------------

`QEMU`_ is a system emulator and "type 2" virtual machine hypervisor. Type 2 hypervisors run on top of the host operating
system. Often, QEMU is used with `KVM`_, which is a Type 1 hypervisor, which can run directly on bare metal. Together,
QEMU and KVM can enable running virtual machines at near-native speeds.

QCOW, which stands for "QEMU Copy On Write," is a format for images used by QEMU. QCOW image files grow according to use,
as opposed to pre-allocating the entire image disk to a file. Ubuntu cloud images with the ``.img`` file type are QCOW
images and are best used with the QEMU hypervisor.

QEMU shell
~~~~~~~~~~

When launching a system it is handy to know that ``ctrl-a c`` (the default QEMU escape sequence followed by ``c``), is
an escape key that will cycle between the console of the guest machine and the QEMU monitor on the host. From the QEMU
monitor a user can send keys to the guest via the ``sendkey`` option or even close the guest via quit.

Creating a seed image
---------------------

Since we are dealing with cloud images here, we will need a cloud-init datasource to use. Refer to
:ref:`use-local-cloud-init-ds` for steps needed to create a seed image for a local cloud-init datasource.

Option 1: Booting the cloud image with SeaBIOS
----------------------------------------------

SeaBIOS is the default firmware used by QEMU.

The following command launches a cloud image with:

* KVM acceleration
* the local machine's CPUs
* 2GB of memory
* serial output to the console, without graphics
* snapshot -- this option will make writes to a temporary file instead of the disk image
  itself. This ensures the base disk is not touched. If at some point, you want
  to persist the changes you've made on the disk, press ``ctrl-a`` (the default QEMU escape sequence) followed by ``s``.
* virtio network device that maps the guest port 22 to host's port 2222
* virtio cloud image
* virtio seed image

.. code:: bash

    qemu-system-x86_64  \
      -cpu host -machine type=q35,accel=kvm -m 2048 \
      -nographic \
      -snapshot \
      -netdev id=net00,type=user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
      -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net00 \
      -drive if=virtio,format=qcow2,file=ubuntu-20.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img \
      -drive if=virtio,format=raw,file=seed.img

You can access this VM via the serial console or you can open
another terminal and ssh to localhost at port 2222:

.. code:: bash

    ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" ubuntu@0.0.0.0 -p 2222

Option 2: Booting the cloud image with UEFI
-------------------------------------------

If you'd prefer using UEFI over BIOS, then a different firmware
is required. Ubuntu ships the ``ovmf`` package to provide UEFI firmware.
Install that package, and you can use a different flash image with
the ``-pflash`` option.

The following command is identical to the one from Option 1, except the last line which specifies
the ``pflash`` option:

.. code::

    qemu-system-x86_64  \
      -cpu host -machine type=q35,accel=kvm -m 2048 \
      -nographic \
      -snapshot \
      -netdev id=net00,type=user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
      -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net00 \
      -drive if=virtio,format=qcow2,file=ubuntu-20.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img \
      -drive if=virtio,format=raw,file=seed.img \
      -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd,readonly

You can confirm that UEFI was used by checking for the existence of the
``/sys/firmware/efi directory``:

.. code::

    $ test -d /sys/firmware/efi && echo efi || echo bios
    efi

Additionally, the ``dmesg`` and ``efibootmgr`` commands will also have EFI related
output:

.. code::

    $ dmesg | grep EFI
    [    0.000000] efi: EFI v2.70 by EDK II
    [    0.505005] fb0: EFI VGA frame buffer device
    [    0.569400] EFI Variables Facility v0.08 2004-May-17

    $ sudo efibootmgr
    BootCurrent: 0002
    Timeout: 0 seconds
    BootOrder: 0000,0001,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006
    Boot0000* UiApp
    Boot0001* UEFI QEMU DVD-ROM QM00005
    Boot0002* UEFI Misc Device
    Boot0003* UEFI Misc Device 2
    Boot0004* UEFI PXEv4 (MAC:525400123456)
    Boot0005* UEFI HTTPv4 (MAC:525400123456)
    Boot0006* EFI Internal Shell
