   * - Format description
     - QCOW image files are disk image files containing raw sector-by-sector copies of a storage device.
   * - Use cases
     - 
       QCOW images are used for creating bootable disks and virtual machines in virtualization environments. Some of the features that make QCOW images attractive are their support for dynamic disk sizing, snapshot support and copy-on-write. 

       One of the primary use cases of our published QCOW images is to use QEMU to create and manage virtual machines. Other providers, such as VirtualBox, can be used for this, or you can use a ``.img`` file to create a bootable USB drive or deploy in an embedded system.

       Refer to :ref:`qcow-qemu` for instructions on using QCOW images with QEMU.

                                a splat. Looking at the remove function here is a chance that we will drop a 
                                rule that maps to a non-deactivated element. Removal happens in two steps, 
                                first we do a lookup for key k and return the generation. Then, in a second 
                                step, the element gets removed from the set/map. The _remove function does 
                                not work correctly if we have more than one element that share the same key. 
                                This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already holds 
                                an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing key has timed
                                out or is not active in the next generation. In such case its possible that 
                                removal will unmap the wrong element. If this happens, we will leak the 
                                non-deactivated element, it becomes unreachable. The element that got 
                                deactivated (and will be freed later) will remain reachable in the set data 
                                structure, this can result in a crash when such an element is retrieved during 
                                lookup (stale pointer). Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact 
                                map to the element that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step. 
                                If not, we need to continue searching. Add a bug/warn trap at the end of the 
                                function as well, the remove function must not ever be called with an

                                Quoting Pablo: add_elem(\"00000000\") timeout 100 ms ... add_elem(\"0000000X\")

                                removes element 0000000X Then, KASAN shows a splat. Looking at the remove 
                                function there is a chance that we will drop a rule that maps to a 
                                non-deactivated element. Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup 
                                for key k and return the to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in 
                                the next generation. Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from 
                                the set/map. The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than 
                                one element that share the same key. This can happen if we insert an element 
                                into a set when the set already holds an element with same key, but the element 
                                mapping to the existing key has timed out or is not active in the next 
                                generation. In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element. 
                                If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes unreachable.
                                The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will remain reachable 
                                in the set data structure, this can result in a crash when such an element 
                                is retrieved during lookup (stale pointer). Add a check that the fully matching 
                                key does in fact map to the element that we have marked as inactive in the 
                                deactivation step. If not, we need to continue searching. Add a bug/warn trap 
                                at the end of the function as well, the remove function must not ever be called 
                                with an invisible/unreachable/non-existent element. v2: avoid uneeded temporary
