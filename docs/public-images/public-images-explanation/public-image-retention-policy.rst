Public images retention policies
================================

All Ubuntu images on `cloud-images.ubuntu.com`_ go through a life-cycle of: *release* > *deprecation* > *deletion*. 

Whenever a new daily image is built and released, all the previous serials for that image are deprecated except for the last 6. This policy determines when an image will be deleted, at which point it is no longer available for use.


Image retention policy
----------------------

.. include:: ../../reuse/common-intro.txt
   :start-after: Start: Daily vs release images
   :end-before: End: Daily vs release images

For more details about these image types, check out our documentation of :doc:`image release types <all-clouds:all-clouds-explanation/release-types>`.

The retention policy can be summarized as follows:

  - **EOSS** refers to when an LTS Ubuntu release (for example, Bionic Beaver 18.04 LTS) has reached "End of Standard Support"
