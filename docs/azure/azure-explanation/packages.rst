Packages maintained by Canonical for Azure
==========================================

The team responsible for publishing and maintaining Ubuntu cloud-images on Azure, also known as the CPC Azure team, is also responsible for the maintenance of the following packages:

 * `walinuxagent <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/walinuxagent>`_
 * `azure-proxy-agent <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/azure-proxy-agent>`_
 * `azure-vm-utils <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/azure-vm-utils>`_

The team is subscribed to these packages on Launchpad either via the larger `ubuntu-public-cloud <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-public-cloud>`_ team or directly as `cpc-azure <https://launchpad.net/~cpc-azure>`_.
