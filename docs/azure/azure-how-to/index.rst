How-to guides
=============

These guides provide instructions related to launching and using Ubuntu instances on Azure. They help you to perform different operations related to our products on Azure.

The most basic requirement for performing most operations is the Azure CLI. 

* :doc:`Install Azure CLI <instances/install-azure-cli>`

Next you'd need to find and launch appropriate images:

* :doc:`Find images <instances/find-ubuntu-images>`
* :doc:`Launch images <instances/launch-ubuntu-images>`

Since security is always an important consideration, you might want to check for available security upgrades, install Ubuntu Pro and perform relevant upgrades:

* :doc:`Check for available security updates <instances/check-available-security-updates>`
* :doc:`Get Ubuntu Pro <instances/get-ubuntu-pro>`
* :doc:`Upgrade from Focal to Jammy <instances/upgrade-from-focal-to-jammy>`

You can also create golden images to simplify your estate management:

* :doc:`Create a Pro golden image <instances/create-pro-fips-golden-image>`
* :doc:`Create a golden image pipeline <instances/create-a-golden-image-pipeline>`


Finally, you might want to deploy specific solutions like SQL Server and Kubeflow on Azure:

* :doc:`Deploy an Ubuntu VM with SQL Server <instances/provision-an-ubuntu-virtual-machine-running-sql-server-in-azure>`
* `Install Kubeflow on AKS (external link)`_
* :doc:`Deploy Kubeflow with AKS spot instances <instances/deploy-kubeflow-pipelines-with-aks-spot-instances>`
