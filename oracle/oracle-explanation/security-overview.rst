Security features with Ubuntu on Oracle Cloud
=============================================

Ubuntu images on Oracle Cloud include the security features provided by both Ubuntu and Oracle Cloud. Some of these features might need to be specifically enabled. This explanation provides pointers to these features.

Ubuntu on AWS provides all the security features available on Ubuntu Server. A detailed description of these features can be found on the `Ubuntu security page`_ and in our explanation about :doc:`Security in the Ubuntu cloud images <all-clouds:all-clouds-explanation/security-overview>`. For further guidance on usage refer to  Ubuntu server's `Introductory page on security`_.
