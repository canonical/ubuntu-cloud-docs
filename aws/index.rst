Ubuntu on AWS
======================================================

Whether you are moving to Amazon Web Services or are already running cloud-native, 
Ubuntu is the platform of choice for AWS.

Canonical continuously tracks and delivers updates to Ubuntu images to ensure security 
and stability are built-in from the moment your machines and containers launch.

Today, Ubuntu powers billions of mission-critical workloads.
