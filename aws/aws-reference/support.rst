Support options on AWS
============================

Ubuntu Pro on AWS
-----------------
Ubuntu Pro provides numerous support options. Please see the :doc:`Pro <pro>` page for 
more details.


Canonical support
-----------------
Purchasing Pro through the AWS provides a convenient mechanism for getting access to the above features
using a unified billing portal. However, Ubuntu pro images published under the
`Canonical Group Limited marketplace seller <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=ubuntu+pro&CREATOR=565feec9-3d43-413e-9760-c651546613f2&filters=CREATOR>`_
account or launched through to the EC2 console does not include phone support. 
If you would like to receive 24/5 or 24/7 phone support you can do so with the following options.

* Private offers for marketplace listings
* Ubuntu Pro tokens

Ubuntu Pro tokens can not be purchased through unified billing, but it offers flexibility in where
you deploy Pro. For instance, it can be used to provide Pro entitlements on on premise or hybrid
cloud deployments.

To purchase phone support please reach out to aws@canonical.com.


Amazon front line support
-------------------------
Canonical and Amazon collaborate on publishing Ubuntu Pro images
through the `Amazon Web Services marketplace <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=ubuntu+pro&CREATOR=e6a5002c-6dd0-4d1e-8196-0a1d1857229b&filters=CREATOR>`_.
Users of these images are able to get support directly through the
`AWS support portal <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=technical>`_.


Public Bug Tracker
------------------
The Canonical Public Cloud (CPC) team maintains a bug tracker for all cloud images. If you find
a problem with a cloud image you case `file a bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-images/+filebug>`_.
When creating a bug please describe the issue, provide a minimal reproducer, and ensure you include
which AMI you see this issue on. CPC regularly triage issues but note that support here is
best effort.
